Assignment from ResoluteAI.in- AI Labs

Role: Machine Learning Engineer: Intern
Duration: 4 days


Computer Vision + Python
Complexity: Hard

Task: Process any open source/Licence free traffic video from web to show following analysis.

Display on frame:
1. Detect: Bounding box on vehicles (can use opensource AI models)
2. Tracking: trailing tail on each box

Real-time stats
1. Number of vehicles in frame.
2. Moving vehicles in frame
3. stopped vehicles in frame
4. Current density of vehicles on different lanes

density = Number of vehicles on lane/sec

Summary:
1. Average vehicles passing the junction
2. Average stop time
3. Average density of vehicles on forward lane and Backward lane 
density = Average Number of vehicles on lane/sec
4. Peak time (can be peak minute if video is only few minutes long)

User story:
As a user I should be able to,
1. start a server
2. Go to server URL to upload video link
3. Once uploaded, Processed frames are displayed on the screen with the above stats and summary.
4. Play , Pause, Stop the video playing on screen
5. Returns to homepage upon clicking stop button

You are free to use open source models and codes, but please ensure that there is no complete copy paste done.
1. Create Flask server to accept the videos
2. Well thought & good looking UI/Front-end will be added advantage.
